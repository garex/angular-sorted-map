# Angular SortedMap

Angular `ng-repeat` ready SortedMap implementation

## Why

Native JavaScript Map and it's polyfills non-compatible with angular's `ng-repeat` directive.
Also currently JavaScript dont' have out-of-the-box SortedMap implementation.

So I'm try to provide it.

## Where to use?

This version should be used only in browsers and in AngularJS projects.
As there are many other good implementations for node and plain javascript.
